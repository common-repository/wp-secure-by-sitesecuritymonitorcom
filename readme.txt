== Description ==
<BR>
Welcome to the WP-Secure Plugin for Wordpress - By <a href="http://www.sitesecuritymonitor.com">SiteSecurityMonitor.com</A>.  We have provided this plugin free of charge to the WordPress community!  We developed this solution initially for our customers - and decided to release it to the community.  We have found over time that the same basic issues confound our users, and that basic WordPress security settings are not being applied.
